== CLI Adapter

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

The extension provides an adapter for Quarkus CLI applications that enables them to expose MCP capabilities.

By adding the dependency below to the CLI project, the CLI `TopCommand` will be added a new option `--mcp` that can 
be used to start the MCP server.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.mcp</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-mcp-server-cli-adapter</artifactId>
    <version>${quarkus-mcp.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The MCP sever will automatically adapt all subcommands reachable from the `TopCommand` and expose them as MCP commands.
